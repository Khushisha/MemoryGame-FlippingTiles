# MemoryGame-FlippingTiles
Swing was used in the construction of this Java-based game programme. With an even number of tiles, each number having a partner, this game is meant to test our memory. All of the tiles must be kept facing downward, they must be turned over one at a time, and when two tiles match, they are taken out of the tile. The tiles are left in their original positions when there is no match.
